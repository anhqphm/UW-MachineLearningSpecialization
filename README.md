# University of Washington - Machine Learning Specialization 

Programming Assignments for Machine Learning Specialization from University of Washington offered through Coursera.




Specialization Courses:

1. Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach

This course gave a broad overview of different machine learning algorithms and how they are applied in real-world situations


- Regression: Predicting House Prices (Leverage Zillow data to build linear regression model to predict house prices)

- Classification: Analyzing Sentiment (Build logistic classification model to analyze product sentiment)

- Clustering and Similarity: Retrieving Documents (conduct cluster analysis for document retreival, tf-dif)

- Recommending Products: Build Matrix Factorization Model and leverage Jaccard Similarity to Recommend Songs


2. Machine Learning: Regression

Project Overview: How to predict a house's price? How to evaluate model? How to prevent model from overfitting?

Simple Linear Regression: Implementing closed-form solution for simple linear regression

Multiple Linear Regression: Exploring multiple regression models for house prediction; Implementing gradient descent for multiple regression

Assessing Performance

Ridge regression

Lasso regression

Kernal regression
